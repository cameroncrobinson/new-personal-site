After a while of exploring different technologies and having my first two jobs being mostly CMS based
(WordPress and Drupal), my next position will be starting off doing QA in .NET applications. I have quite a bit
to relearn. The past two years I have been mostly focusing on front-end frameworks and dipping my toes into design.
I've also been exploring more in digital marketing and anlytics for sites. This is the first dive into true software engineering.
I say that because even though I'm starting out in QA, where I end up by next year is up to me and what effort I choose to put in
both inside and outside of work. My career is really in my hands and I'm actually really excited about this new opportunity I've
been given. It will require a ton of work but I'm completely up to the task and willing to sacrifice my free time to become successful
at being an engineer.
