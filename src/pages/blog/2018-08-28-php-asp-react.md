My main focuses right now are PHP, ASP.NET CORE and React. 
Right now, I'm taking the basic stuff I'm learning about PHP
and building stuff right away with it. Going through the entire
course on Team Treehouse without building anything has led to me 
getting discouraged and feeling like I'm not learning fast enough.
I'm finding that practically buiilding and changing a project of my
own as learn with the videos does a lot to keep me encouraged. Besides PHP,
I'm relearning .NET by learning .NET CORE. What I'm working on now is migrating an
old ASP.NET application I built a couple years ago over to ASP.NET core. I'm also looking into
how I would go about building React components for both PHP applications as well as for .Net applications
Overall, I feel like I'm getting into enjoying learning coding again!
