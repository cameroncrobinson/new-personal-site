I've now begun the process of moving my blog over to Gatsbyjs.
Gatsby is build using react and is more like a static PWA than anything else. It's a great way to get started developing in React and is proving to be a fun little project. I will eventually be using Gatsby for another project as well. For now, I wanted to use it for a personal project to slowly get comfortable with it.
