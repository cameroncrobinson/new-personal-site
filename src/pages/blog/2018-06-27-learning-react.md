With learning React I eventually came across the React for Drupal site. It's honestly a bit of a godsend in that it gives a pretty solid walkthrough of design principles, courses, how-to's and where to starts.
The first place I did start was here. Understanding that even though the main syntax used in React in JSX, it is still essentially just Javascript was nice to know.Â 
I've since been going through the Level Up Tuts tutorials. Within the next few days, most likely this weekend, I'll start building components after I learn a bit more about how to set React on top of Drupal.
