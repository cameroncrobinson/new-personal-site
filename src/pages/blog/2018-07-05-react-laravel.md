So far, I've looked at some of the React documentation and gone through a few tutorials.
What I'm thinking is next is to have a small project where I build a cv.

I've also begun to dive deeper in laravel. I've worked with Blade Templating before and know my way around
templating files but have never truly built a template from complete scratch. That's a little exciting too.
I'll probably make a wireframe in Adobe XD after I look up a few designs so I have an idea of what to make.

Also, Well be sharing the code up on Github. I have the basic [laravel template](https://github.com/cameroncrobinson/basicwebsite) up now that I'll be continuing to edit.
