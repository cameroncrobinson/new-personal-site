As I have begun to do a dive back into .NET, I figured it would probably be best
to actually do something that had a structure to it and not just a bunch of small
exercises here and there. Team Treehouse has a course on C# and one on ASP.Net.
Being in the current state of non-employment this week, if I simply treated the
courses as a full-time job, I could actually be finished with both by the end of
the week. I'm already finding while going through the C# course that I'm no so
much learning how it all works again but rather refereshing myself on what it all does.
It doesn't feel nearly as difficult to go through the course as when I initially
learned the language. In fact, a lot of it feels like review and I'm finding
that I know a lot of the material already. I'll check back in later this week with
an update on how everything is coming along.
